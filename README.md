Optimal Oriented Bounding Box algorithms

## Contents

This repository contains several Matlab scripts implementing algorithms for finding the optimal oriented bounding box of a set of points.

In `src/HYBBRID`, you will find the reference implementation for the HYBBRID algoritm described **link to paper**

In `stc/ORourke`, you will find an implementation of Joseph O'Rourke algorithm.

Other methods are available in their own files (*note to Sam: Do not forget to add reference or link to Korsawe's code.*)
